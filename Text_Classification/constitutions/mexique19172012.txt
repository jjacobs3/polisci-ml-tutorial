The competent authorities can restrict the communications of the person accused and convicted of organized crime with others, except the access to their counsel, and can impose special surveillance measures on those who are placed within these establishments. The latter can be applied to the other inmates that require special measures of security in terms of the law.
Article 19
No detention before a judicial authority will exceed the time of seventy-two hours, from when the accused is put at its disposition, without justifying it with an order for indictment to process [auto de vinculación a proceso] in which is expressed: the crime imputed to the accused; the place, time and circumstances of its execution, as well as the evidence [datos] that establish that an act has been committed that the law specifies as a crime, and that the probability exists that the suspect committed it or participated in its commission.
The Public Ministry may only solicit the judge for preventive detention when other precautionary measures are not sufficient to guarantee the appearance of the accused at the trial, for the development of the investigation, for the protection of the victim, of the witnesses or of the community, as well as when the accused is being tried or has been previously sentenced for the commission of a grave crime. The judge will order the preventive detention, officially, in the cases of organized crime, grave homicide, rape, kidnapping, trafficking in persons, crimes committed with violent means such as arms and explosives, as well as grave crimes the law determines as contrary to the security of the Nation, the free development of personality and of health.
The law shall determine the cases in which the judge may revoke the liberty of individuals indicted.
The time period to issue the order for indictment may be extended solely at the petition of the suspect, in the form that the law specifies. The prolonging of detention to their prejudice will be punished by the criminal law. The authority responsible for the establishment in which the suspect has been interned, that does not receive an authorized copy of the order for indictment and of the order of preventive detention, within the time limit specified, or of the request for extension of the constitutional time period, must bring the attention of the judge to this particular, in the same act of concluding the time period and, if he does not receive the mentioned confirmation [constancia] in the following three hours, the suspect will be released.
Any process will be forcefully prosecuted for the criminal act or acts specified in the order for indictment to process. If as a result of a process it should come to light [apareciere] that a separate crime has been committed from that one prosecuted [persigue], it must be [made] the object of [a] separate investigation, without prejudice that the consolidation may be decreed later, if it should be conducive.
If subsequent to the issuance of the order for indictment to process for organized crime, the accused evades the action of justice or is placed at the disposition of another judge who claims them abroad, the process will be suspended, along with the deadlines for the prescription of the criminal action.
Any mistreatment in the apprehension or in the prisons, any intervention [molestia] that occurs without legal motive, any tax [gabela] or contribution, in the prisons, are abuses to be corrected by the laws and reprimanded by the authorities.

Article 27
The ownership of the lands and waters included within the boundaries of the national territory, corresponds originally in the Nation, which has had, and has, the right to transfer the dominion of these to private persons, thereby constituting private property.
Expropriations may only take place for reasons of public utility and with indemnization.
The Nation will at all times have the right to impose on private property the modalities dictated by the public interest, as well as to regulate, for social benefit, the use of the natural resources [elementos] susceptible to appropriation, with the objective of having an equitable distribution of the public wealth, to care for its conservation, to achieve the balanced development of the country and the improvement of the conditions of life of the rural and urban population.
Consequently, the necessary measures shall be taken to order [ordenar] the human settlements and to establish adequate provisions, uses [usos], reserves and purposes [destinos] for lands, waters and forests, to effect the execution of public works and of planning and to regulate the foundation, conservation, betterment and growth of the centers of population; to preserve and restore the ecological balance; for the dividing of the latifundios [large estates]; to provide for [disponer], in the terms of the regulatory law, the collective organization and exploitation of the ejidos [public collectively-owned lands] and communities; for the development of pequeña [small rural parcel] ownership; for the promotion of agriculture, of animal husbandry [ganadería], of forestry and of other economic activities in the rural domain [medio], and to avoid the destruction of the natural resources [elementos] and the damages that property may suffer with prejudice to society.
To the Nation corresponds the direct ownership [dominio] of all natural resources [recursos] of the continental shelf and the submarine foundations [zócalos] of the islands; of all the minerals or substances which, in veins, ledges, masses or deposits [yacimientos], constitute deposits of a nature distinct from the components of the soil [terrenos] itself, such as the minerals from which industrial metals and metalloids, used in industry[,] are extracted; deposits of precious stones, of rock salt and the salts formed directly by sea waters; the products derived from the decomposition of rocks, when their exploitation necessitates subterranean works; the mineral or organic deposits of materials susceptible to be utilized as fertilizers; the solid combustible minerals; petroleum and all the solid, liquid, and gaseous hydrocarbons; and the space situated above the national territory, to the extent and the terms that the International Law establishes.
The following are property of the Nation[:] the waters of the territorial seas, to the extent and terms established by the International Law; the inland marine waters; those of the lagoons and estuaries permanently or intermittently connected with the sea; those of the inland lakes of natural formation which are directly connected with streams having a constant flow; those of rivers and their direct or indirect tributaries, from the point in their sources where the first permanent, intermittent, or torrential waters begin, to their mouth in the sea, lakes, lagoons, or estuaries of national property; those of constant or intermittent streams and their direct or indirect tributaries, whenever the bed of the stream in all of its extent or in part of it, serves as a limit of the national territory or of two federative entities, or when it flows from one federative entity to another or crosses the dividing line of the Republic; those of the lakes, lagoons or estuaries whose basins, zones, or shores, are crossed by the dividing lines of two or more entities or between the Republic and a neighboring country, or when the shoreline serves as the boundary between two federative entities or of the Republic with a neighboring country; those of the springs that issue from the beaches, maritime zones, beds, basins, or shores of the lakes, lagoons, or estuaries of national property; and those that are extracted from the mines; and the beds, channels, or shores of the interior lakes and streams to the extent that the law establishes. The waters of the subsoil may be brought to the surface freely through artificial works and appropriated by the owner of the surface land, but when the public interest so requires or other uses are affected, the Federal Executive may regulate its extraction and utilization, and may even establish prohibited [vedadas] zones, as is the same for other waters of national property. Any other waters not included in the preceding enumeration, shall be considered as an integral part of the property of the lands through which they flow or in which they are deposited, but if they are located in two or more properties, their utilization shall be considered of public utility, and shall be subject to the provisions that the States enact.
In those cases to which the two preceding paragraphs refer, the domain of the Nation is inalienable and imprescriptible and the exploitation, the use, or provision of the resources concerned, by individuals or by companies constituted in accordance with the Mexican laws, may not be realized except through concessions, granted by the Federal Executive, in accordance with rules and conditions that the law establishes. The legal norms concerning the works or labors of exploitation of the minerals and substances referred to in the fourth paragraph, shall govern the execution and validation [comprobación] of what is effected or must be effected as from their validity [vigencia], independent of the date of granting of the concession, and their nonobservance may give rise to the cancellation of them. The Federal Government has the faculty to establish national reserves and to abolish them. The corresponding declarations shall be made by the Executive in those cases and conditions that the laws shall provide for. Concerning petroleum and solid, liquid, or gaseous hydrocarbons or radioactive minerals, no concessions or contracts will be granted, nor may those that have been granted continue, and the Nation shall carry out the exploitation of these products, in the terms that the respective Regulatory Law specifies. It corresponds exclusively to the Nation to generate, conduct, transform, distribute, and supply electric energy which has for its objective the provision of a public service. In this matter no concessions will be granted to individuals and the Nation will make use of the assets and natural resources which are required for these objectives.
The provision of nuclear combustibles for the generation of nuclear energy and the regulation of their application to other purposes, corresponds also to the Nation. The use of nuclear energy may only have peaceful objectives.
The Nation exercises in an exclusive economic zone situated outside the territorial sea and adjacent to it, the rights of sovereignty and the jurisdictions as determined by the laws of the Congress. The exclusive economic zone shall extend two hundred nautical miles, measured, beginning from the base line from which the territorial sea is measured. In those cases in which that extension produces a superposition with the exclusive economic zones of other States, the delimitation of the respective zones shall be made in the measure that necessarily results, through agreement with those States.
The capacity to acquire ownership [dominio] of the lands and waters of the
Nation, shall be governed by the following prescriptions:
I. Only Mexicans by birth or naturalization and Mexican companies have the right to acquire ownership of the lands, waters, and their appendages [accesiones], or to obtain concessions for the exploitation of mines or waters.
The State may concede the same right to foreigners, provided they agree before the Secretariat of Relations [Secretaría de Relaciones] to consider themselves as nationals in respect of such assets, and not to invoke, concerning the same assets, the protection of their governments in [matters] concerning them; under the penalty, in case of absence [faltar] of agreement, of loss to the benefit of the
Nation, of the assets that have been acquired by virtue of the same. For no reason may foreigners acquire the direct ownership over lands or waters within a zone [faja] of one hundred kilometers along the frontiers and of fifty [kilometers] along the shores.
The State, in accordance with its internal public interests and the principles of reciprocity, can, in the judgment of the Secretariat of Relations, concede authorization to foreign States to acquire, at the permanent sites of residence of the Federal Powers, private ownership of real property necessary for the direct services of their embassies or legations.
II. The religious associations that are constituted in the terms of Article 130 and its regulatory law have the capacity to acquire, possess or administer, exclusively, the property [bienes] that is indispensable for their objective, with the requirements and limitations that the regulatory law establishes;
III. The charitable institutions, public or private, that have the objective of assistance to those in need, of scientific investigation, the diffusion of teaching, of the reciprocal assistance of those associated, or any other licit objective, may not acquire more real property [bienes raíces] than that indispensable for their objective, immediately or directly allocated to it, subject to that which the regulatory law determines;
IV. Commercial companies [sociedades mercantile] may be owners, by shares, of rural rústicos [rural] lands but only to the extent necessary for the fulfillment their objective.
In no case may companies of this type [clase] have in ownership lands dedicated to agricultural, animal husbandry [ganadería], or forestry activities to a greater extent than the respective equivalent of twenty-five times the limits specified in fraction XV of this Article. The regulatory law shall govern the structure of capital and the minimum number of partners of these companies, to the effect that the lands owned by the company do not exceed in relation to each partner the limits of pequeña [small land] ownership. In this case, all individual share ownership, corresponding to rústicos [rural] lands, will be accumulated for the effects of computation. Likewise, the law shall specify the conditions for foreign participation in these companies.
The same [propia] law shall establish the measures of registration and control necessary for compliance with that provided for in this fraction;
V. The banks duly authorized, in accordance with the laws on institutions of credit, may hold capital mortgages [capitales impuestos], concerning urban and rústicos [rural] properties in accordance with the prescriptions of such laws, but they may not hold in ownership or in administration more real property than is actually necessary for their direct objective;
VI. The States and the Federal District, as well as the municipalities in all of the
Republic, shall have full capacity to acquire and possess all the real property necessary for the public services.
The laws of the Federation and of the States in their respective jurisdictions, shall determine the cases in which the appropriation [ocupación] of private property will be of public utility; and in accordance with such laws the administrative authorities shall make the corresponding declaration. The price that shall be established as indemnization for the thing expropriated, shall be based on the tax valuation [valor fiscal] of it [which] figures in the assessment or tax offices [oficinas catastrales o recaudadores], whether this value had been declared by the owner or simply accepted by him in tacit mode by having paid taxes on that basis. The increase in value or the decrease, concerning specific [particular] property due to improvements or deterioration occurring after the date of the assessment of the tax valuation, will be solely that established subject to expert judgment and to judicial resolution. This same [procedure] shall be observed when it concerns objects having value [which] is not established in the tax offices [oficinas rentísticas].
The exercise of actions that correspond to the Nation, by virtue of the provisions of this Article, shall be made effective by the judicial procedure; but during this procedure and by order of the corresponding tribunals, which must decide in a maximum time of one month, the administrative authorities may proceed without delay to the appropriation, administration, auction, or sale of the lands or waters in question and all of their appendages, without, in any case, the act being revocable by the same authorities before the executory sentence has been declared.;
VII. The juridical personality of the nuclei [núcleos] of ejido and communal population is recognized, and their ownership concerning the land used for human settlement as well as for productive activities is protected.
The law shall protect the integrity of the lands of the indigenous groups.
The law, in consideration of the respect for and the strengthening of the communal life of the ejidos and communities, shall protect the land for human settlement and shall regulate the exploitation of lands, forests and waters of common use and the provision of actions of support necessary to elevate the standard of living of their inhabitants.
The law, with respect for the will of the ejidatarios and comuneros to adopt the conditions that are most advantageous to them in the exploitation of their productive resources, shall regulate the exercise of the rights of the comuneros concerning the land and of each ejidatario over his parcel. Likewise it shall establish the procedures through which the ejidatarios and comuneros may associate among themselves, with the State or with third parties and concede [otorgar] the use of their lands; and, concerning the ejidatarios, transmit their parcel rights among the members of the nucleus of inhabitants; equally it shall establish the requirements and procedures in accordance with which the assembly of the ejido may grant to the ejidatario ownership of his parcel. In cases of alienation of parcels, the right of preference that the law provides for shall be respected.
Within the same nucleus of population, no ejidatario may be a title holder of more land than that equivalent to 5% of the total of the ejido lands. In any case, the titling of lands in favor of a single ejidatario must be adjusted to the limits specified in fraction XV.
The general assembly is the supreme organ of the nucleus of the ejido or community population, with the organization and functions that the law specifies. The comisariado of the ejido or of [the] communal property, elected democratically in the terms of the law, is the organ of representation of the nucleus and responsible for executing the resolutions of the assembly.
The restitution of lands, forests and waters to the nuclei of inhabitants shall be made in the terms of the regulatory law;
VIII. The following are declared null:

Article 106
It corresponds to the Judicial Power of the Federation, in the terms of the respective law, to settle [dirimir] the disputes that, by reason of competence, arise between the Tribunals of the Federation, between these and those of the States or of the Federal District, between those of one State and those of another, or between those of one State and those of the Federal District.
Article 107
The disputes that Article 103 of the Constitution concerns, with the exception of those in electoral matters, will be subject to the procedures and formalities [formas] of the juridical order that the law determines, in accordance with the following bases:
I. A trial in amparo will always be held [seguirá] at the instance of the party injured [agrivada], having such character any person claiming to be entitled titular to a right or to an individual or collective interest, whenever it is alleged that the challenged act violates the rights recognized by the Constitution and furthermore affects its juridical sphere, either in direct manner or by virtue of its special situation before [frente] the juridical order.
Concerning the acts or resolutions proceeding from the judicial, administrative or labor tribunals, the complainant must claim to be entitled to a subjective right that affects them in a personal and direct manner;
II. The decisions that are issued in the actions of amparo only concern [ocuparán] the complainants who have solicited them, being limited to the protections [amparlos y protegerlos], if it proceeds, in the special case concerning which the demand refers.
When the actions of indirect amparo in revision [amparo indirecto en revisión] resolve the unconstitutionality of a general norm for the second consecutive occasion, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation informs the corresponding emitting authority of it.
When the organs of the Judicial Power of the Federation establish jurisprudence by reiteration in which the unconstitutionality of a general norm is determined, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation notifies the emitting authority of it.
Within the time of 90 natural days from which the problem of unconstitutionality is resolved [supere], the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation will issue, providing that there is approval by a majority of at least eight votes, the general declaration of unconstitutionality, in which shall be established its scope and conditions in terms of the regulatory law.
That provided for in the two previous paragraphs will not be applicable to general norms in tax matters.
In the actions of amparo, the deficiency of the concepts of violation or grievance [agravio] must be addressed in agreement with that which the regulatory law provides.
When acts are challenged [reclamen] that have or could have as a consequence the deprivation of the ownership or of the possession and enjoyment of their lands, waters, pastures, and forests of the ejidos[,] or of the nuclei of populations that de facto [de hecho] or de jure [por derecho] protect the communal status [estado], or of the ejidatorios or comuneros, all the evidence that could be beneficial to the entities and individuals mentioned must be obtained, of office, and the diligences that are deemed necessary to make their agrarian rights specific, as well as the nature and effects of the acts challenged, must be accorded.
In the actions [juicios] to which the previous paragraph refers, the dismissal of proceedings [sobreseimiento] for procedural inactivity or for the lapse of prosecution [caducidad de la instancia], will not proceed, in prejudice to the ejidal or communal nuclei, or to the ejidatorios of comuneros, but one or the other can be decreed to their benefit. When acts are challenged that affect the collective rights of the nucleus[,] the withdrawal of [desistimiento] or the consent to [consentimiento] these same acts, may also not proceed, unless that the first has been agreed to by the General Assembly of the second emanates from it;
III. When acts of judicial, administrative or labor tribunals are challenged, the amparo will only proceed:
a) Against definitive judgments [sentencias] or awards and resolutions that bring an end to the action, either that the violation is committed in them or that, committed during the procedure, affect the defenses of the complainant transcending the results of the judgment [fallo]. Concerning the amparo to which this paragraph and fraction V of this Article refers, the Collegiate Circuit Tribunal must decide concerning all the procedural violations that should be established, and those which, when they proceed, result in substitution of the complaint, and establish the precise terms in which the new resolution must be issued. If the procedural violations do not result in [invocaron] a first amparo, or if the corresponding Collegiate Tribunal has asserted them, of office, in the cases in which the substitution of the complaint proceeds, it may not be a matter of concept of violation, nor of officious diligences [estudios] in subsequent actions of amparo.
The party that has obtained the favorable decision and that has juridical interest in which the challenged act subsists, must present amparo in a form adhesive to that advanced by any of the parties that participated [intervinieron] in the action from which the challenge emanated [emana]. The law shall determine the form and terms in which it must be advanced [promoverse].
For the procedure of the action, the ordinary recourses that are established in the law of the matter must be exhausted previously, by virtue of which those definitive decisions, awards and resolutions maybe modified or revoked, except in the case where the law permits renunciation of the recourses.
To challenge the definitive decisions, awards or resolutions that bring the action to an end, the violation of the laws of the procedure must be established, whenever the complainant has challenged them during the conduct of the action by way of the recourse or defenses that, in this case, specify the respective ordinary law. This requirement [requsito] will not be required [exigible] in amparos against acts that affect the rights of minors or the incapacitated, to civil estate, or to the order or stability of the family, or in those of criminal nature promoted by the sentenced person;
b) Against acts in trial of which the execution would be of impossible reparation, out of court, or at its conclusion, once the recourses that in such case may proceed are exhausted, and
c) Against acts that affect persons extraneous [extrañas] to the action;
IV. In administrative matters, amparo may proceed, as well, against acts or omissions that originate from specific [distintas] authorities of the judicial, administrative or labor tribunals, and that cause a grievance not reparable through any measure of legal defense. It will be necessary to exhaust these measures of defense whenever, by conforming to the same laws, the effects of these acts are suspended, of office or thorough interposition of the action, recourse or means of legal defense that the injured [party] has established, with the same scope that the regulatory laws provide and without requiring greater requirements than those that the same consign to concede the definitive suspension, nor greater time that that established for the concession of the provisional suspension, independently from whether the act itself is considered susceptible or not of being suspended in accordance with the law.
The obligation to exhaust such recourses or measures or defense does not exist if the challenged act lacks substantiation [fundamentación] or when only direct violation of this Constitution is alleged;
V. Amparo against definitive decisions, awards or resolutions which bring an end to the action shall be brought before the competent Collegiate Circuit Tribunal in accordance with the law, in the following cases:
a) In criminal matters, against definitive resolutions dictated by judicial tribunals, being those federal [ones] of common or military order.
b) In administrative matters, when particular definitive sentences and resolutions which bring an end to the trial, dictated by administrative or judicial tribunals, are challenged by individuals, not reparable by an recourse, action or ordinary measure of legal defense;
c) In civil matters, when definitive sentences are challenged which were decreed in federal or commercial trials, it being a federal or local authority issuing the decision [fallo], or in trials of the common order.
In the civil actions of Federal order, the decisions can be challenged in amparo by any of the parties, including by the Federation, in defense of their patrimonial interests, and
d) In labor matters, when awards dictated by Local or Federal Boards [Juntas] of Conciliation and Arbitration, or by the Federal Tribunal of Conciliation and Arbitration of the Workers at the Service of the State [Tribunal Federal de Conciliación y Arbitraje de los Trabajadores al Servicio del Estado], are challenged;
The Supreme Court of Justice can, of office or on substantiated petition of the corresponding Collegiate Circuit Tribunal, or of the Procurator General of the Republic, take cognizance of the direct amparos that by their interest and transcendence so merit it.
VI. In the cases to which the preceding fraction refers, the regulatory law shall specify the procedure and the terms to which the Collegiate Circuit Tribunals and, in such case, the Supreme Court of Justice, must submit themselves to dictate their respective resolutions;
VII. Amparo against acts or omissions at trial, outside of trial or after its conclusion, or that affect persons extraneous to the action, against grievances or against acts or omissions of administrative authority, will be interposed before the District Judge under whose jurisdiction the place is located in which the act challenged was executed or was to be executed, and its conduct will be limited to the report of the authority, at one hearing for which will be cited in the same order auto that the report is required to be produced [se mande pedir] and to receive the evidence that the interested parties offer and to hear the allegations, issuing [pronunciándose] the decision in the same hearing;
VIII. Against the decisions that the District Judges or the Unitary Circuit Tribunals, issued in amparo, revision proceeds. The Supreme Court of Justice shall take cognizance of them:
a) When general norms have been challenged in the demand of amparo, for considering them [estimaraos] directly in violation of this Constitution, the issue [problema] of constitutionality subsisting in the recourse.
b) When it concerns those cases comprehended in fractions II and III of Article 103 of this Constitution.
The Supreme Court of Justice, of office or on substantiated petition of the corresponding Collegiate Circuit Tribunal, or of the Procurator General of the Republic, will take cognizance of the amparos in revision, that by their interest and transcendence so merit it.
In the cases not provided for in the previous paragraphs, the Collegiate Circuit Tribunals will take cognizance of the revision and their decisions will not admit any recourse;
IX. In matters of direct amparo, the recourse of revision proceeds against the decisions that resolve [matters] concerning the constitutionality of general norms, establishing the direct interpretation of the precept of this Constitution or omitting to decide concerning such questions when these have been raised, whenever it establishes a criterion of importance and transcendence, according to what the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation provides, in compliance with the general directives [acuerdos] of the Plenary. The matters of recourse shall be limited to the decision of the questions appropriately constitutional, without power to consider [comprender] others;
X. The challenged acts may be the object of suspension in the cases and by way of the conditions that the regulatory law determines, for which the jurisdictional organ of amparo, when the nature of the act permits it, must produce [realizar] a thoughtful analysis of the likelihood of beneficial [buen] law and of social interest.
This suspension must be granted with respect to definitive decisions in criminal matters by communicating the prosecution [promoción] of amparo, and in civil, commercial and administrative matters, by way of surety [garantía] made by the complainant to respond to the damages and prejudices that such suspension may cause to the third party interested. The suspension shall be without effect of the latter gives counter-surety [contagarantía] to assure the restoration of matters [cosas] to the state they should be in [guardaban] if the amparo is conceded and to pay the consequential damages and prejudices;
XI. The complaint of direct amparo will be presented before the responsible authority, which shall decide concerning the suspension. In the other cases the complaint will be presented before the District Judges or the Unitary Circuit Tribunals which shall decide concerning the suspension, or before the Tribunals of the State in the cases that the law so authorizes;
XII. The violation of the guarantees of Articles 16, in criminal matters, and 19 and 20 will be claimed [reclamará] before the superior of the tribunal that committed it, or before the District Judge or Unitary Circuit Tribunal that corresponds, requesting recourse, in either case, to the decisions that are issued, in the terms prescribed by fraction VIII.
If the District Judge or the Unitary Circuit Tribunal does not reside in the same place as the responsible authority, the law shall determine the judge or tribunal before which the writ [escrito] of amparo is to be presented, which may provisionally suspend the act challenged, in the cases and terms that the same law establishes;
XIII. When Collegiate Tribunals of one same Circuit sustain contradictory opinions [tesis] in the actions of amparo of their competence, the Procurator General of the Republic, the tribunals mentioned and their members, the District Judges or the parties in those matters that have motivated them, may denounce the contradiction before the corresponding Circuit Plenary, to the end that it decides on the opinion that must prevail as jurisprudence.
When the Circuit Plenaries of specific Circuits, the Circuit Plenaries in specialized matters of the same Circuit or the Collegiate Tribunals of one same circuit with different specialization, sustain contradictory opinions to resolve the contradictions or the matters of their competence, as it corresponds, the Ministers of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, those of the Circuit Plenaries, as well as the organs to which the prior paragraph refers, may denounce the contradiction before the Supreme Court of Justice, with the objective that the respective Plenary of Chamber, decides on the opinion that must prevail.
When the Chambers of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation sustain contradictory opinions in the actions of amparo of which they are competent to take cognizance, the ministers, the Collegiate Circuit Tribunals and their members, the District Judges, the Procurator General of the Republic or the parties in the matters that motivated them, may denounce the contradiction before the Plenary of the Supreme Court, in accordance with the regulatory law, so that it resolves the contradiction.
The resolutions that the Plenary or the Chambers of the Supreme Court of Justice as well as the Circuit Plenaries issue in accordance with the previous paragraphs, will only have the effect of establishing jurisprudence and will not affect the specific juridical situation deriving from the judgments issued in the trials in which the contradiction has occurred;
XIV. [Abrogated]
XV. The Procurator General of the Republic or the Agent of the Federal Public Ministry designated to [this] effect will be a party in all actions of amparo, but they can abstain from intervening in such cases, when the cases concerned lack [carezca], in their opinion, public interest.
XVI. If the authority did not comply with the decision that concedes the amparo, but this non-compliance is justified, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, in agreement with the procedure provided for by the regulatory law, shall grant a reasonable time for its compliance to proceed, a time that can be extended on the request of the authority. When it is unjustified or the time has elapsed without there having been compliance, it shall proceed to remove from office [cargo] the titular member of the authority responsible and consign him to the District Judge. The same orders [providencias] will take place respecting the superior hierarchy of the authority responsible if it should have incurred responsibility, as well as those titular persons who, having occupied the office previously in the authority responsible, have not complied with the execution.
If the amparo is conceded, [and] the challenged act is repeated, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, in accordance with the procedures established in the regulatory law, shall proceed to remove from office [cargo] the titular member of the authority responsible, and bring it to the attention of the Federal Public Ministry, except when there has not been deceitful activity and the repeated act was done [deje] without effects before the resolution of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation is issued.
The substitute compliance with the decision of amparo may be solicited by the complainant to the jurisdictional organ, or decreed of office by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, when the execution of the sentence affects society in greater proportion than the benefit that the complainant may obtain, or when, by the circumstances of the case, is impossible or gravely disproportionate to restore the situation that governed before the violation. The incidental issue [incidente] has for its effect that the execution is made for compliance by way of payment of damages and prejudices to the complainant.
No action of amparo whatever may be filed, unless the decision that concedes the constitutional protection has been complied with;
XVII. The authority responsible that disobeys an order [auto] of suspension or that, before such measure, accepts through bad faith or negligence, security [fianza] or countersecurity [contrafianza] that is illusory or insufficient, will be criminally sanctioned;
XVIII. [Abrogated]
TITLE FOUR
Of the Responsibilities of the Public and Patrimonial Servants of the State
Article 108
For the effects of the responsibilities to which this Title refers, the representatives of popular election, the members of the Federal Judicial Power and of the Judicial Power of the Federal District, the functionaries and employees and, in general, any person that performs a job [empleo], office [cargo] or commission of any nature in the Congress of the Union, in the Legislative Assembly of the Federal District or in the Federal Public Administration or in the Federal District, as well as the public servants of the organs to which this Constitution grants autonomy, will be reputed [to be] public servants who will be responsible for the acts or omissions in which they incur in the performance of their respective functions.
The President of the Republic, during the time of his responsibilities [encargo], may only be impeached [acusado] for treason against the country and for grave crimes of the common order.
The Governors of the States, the Deputies of the Local Legislatures, the Magistrates of the Local Superior Tribunals of Justice and, as the case may be, the members of the Councils of the Local Judicatures will be responsible for violations of this Constitution and of the federal laws, as well as for improper management of federal funds and resources.
The Constitutions of the States of the Republic shall make precise [precisarán], in the same terms of the first paragraph of this Article and for the effects of their responsibilities, the character of public servants of those performing a job, office or commission in the States and in the Municipalities.
Article 109
The Congress of the Union and Legislature of the States, within the domains [ámbitos] of their respective competences, shall adopt [expedirán] the laws of responsibilities of the public servants, and the other norms conducive to sanction those who, having this character, incur in responsibility, in accordance with the following safeguards [prevenciones]:
I. The sanctions indicated in Article 110 will be imposed through a political trial [juicio politico], on the public servants specified in the same precept, when in the exercise of their functions they incur in acts or omissions that are prejudicial to [redunden en perjuicio] the fundamental public interests or to their good management [despacho].
The political trial does not proceed for the mere expression of ideas.
II. The commission of crimes on the part of any public servant will be prosecuted and sanctioned in the terms of the criminal legislation; and
III. Administrative sanctions will be applied to the public servants for the acts or omissions that affect the legality, honesty, loyalty, impartiality and efficiency that they must observe in performance their jobs [empleos], offices [cargos] or commissions.
The procedures for the application of the sanctions mentioned will be developed autonomously. Sanctions of the same nature may not be imposed two times for a single act [conducta].
The laws shall determine the cases and the circumstances in which the public servants must be criminally sanctioned for cause of illicit enrichment that during their time in their responsibilities [encargo], or by reasons [motivos] of it, by themselves or by a third person [interpósita], they substantially augment their patrimony, acquire assets or conduct themselves as owners concerning them, of which the licit origin [procedencia] could not be justified. The criminal laws will sanction with seizure and with privation of the ownership of these assets, as well as the other penalties that correspond.
Any citizen, under the most strict responsibility and through the presentation of elements of proof, may formulate an accusation [denuncia] before the Chamber of Deputies of the Congress of the Union with respect to the conduct to which this Article refers.
Article 110
The senators and deputies of the Congress of the Union, the ministers of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, the Councilors of the Federal Judicature, the Secretaries of the Cabinet, the deputies of the Assembly of the Federal District, the Head of Government of the Federal District, the Procurator General of the Republic, the Procurator General of Justice of the Federal District, the Circuit Magistrates and the District Judges, the magistrates and judges of Common Law [Fuero Común] of the Federal District, the Councilors of the Judicature of the Federal District, the Councilor President, the electoral councilors, and the executive secretary of the Federal Electoral Institute, the magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal, the directors general and their equivalents of the decentralized organs [organismos], enterprises with majority state participation, companies and associations incorporated to them and public trusts [fideicomisos públicos], may be the subject of political trial.
The governors of the States, Local Deputies, Magistrates of the Local Superior Tribunals of Justice and, as the case may be, the members of the Councils of the Local Judicatures, may only be subject to political trial in the terms of this Title for grave violations of this Constitution and the federal laws that emanate from it, as well as for the improper management of federal funds and resources, but in this case the resolution will be declarative only [únicamente] and it will be communicated to the Local Legislatures so that, in exercise of their attributions, they may proceed correspondingly.
The sanction will consist of the dismissal of the public servant and in their disqualification for performing the functions, jobs [empleos], offices or commissions of any nature in the public service.
For the application of sanctions to which this precept refers, the Chamber of Deputies will proceed with the respective accusation, before the Chamber of Senators, with prior declaration of the absolute majority of the number of the members present in session of that Chamber, once having substantiated the respective procedure and on hearing [audiencia] the accused [inculpada].
Having taken cognizance of the accusation, the Chamber of Senators, constituted [erigida] as a grand jury [Jurado de sentencia], will apply the corresponding sanction through a resolution of the two-thirds part of its members present in session, once the corresponding diligences have been practiced and on hearing the accused.
The declarations and resolutions of the Chambers of Deputies and Senators are unchallengeable [inatacables].
Article 111
To proceed criminally against the deputies and senators of the Congress of the Union, the ministers of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, the magistrates of the Superior Chamber of the Electoral Tribunal, the councilors to the Federal Judicature, the Secretaries of the Cabinet, the deputies of the
Assembly of the Federal District, the Head of Government of the Federal District, the Procurator General of the Republic and the Procurator General of Justice of the Federal District, as well as the Councilor President and the electoral councilors of the General Council of the Federal Electoral Institute, for the commission of crimes during the time of their responsibilities [encargo], the Chamber of Deputies will declare by absolute majority of its members present in session, if there are or are not grounds [lugar] to proceed against the accused.
If the resolution of the Chamber should be negative, any further [ulterior] procedure will be suspended, but this will not be an obstacle for the imputation for the commission of the crime to continue its course when the accused has concluded the exercise of their responsibility [encargo], since it does not prejudice the bases of the accusation.
If the Chamber declares there are grounds to proceed, the accused [sujeto] shall be brought to the disposition of the competent authorities so that they may act in accordance with the law.
Regarding the President of the Republic, there are only grounds to accuse him before the Chamber of Senators in the terms of Article 110. Under this postulate [supuesto], the Chamber of Senators will resolve it on the basis of the criminal legislation applicable.
For power to proceed criminally for federal crimes against the Governors of the States, Local Deputies, Magistrates of the Superior Tribunals of Justice and, as the case may be, the members of the Councils of the Local Judicatures, the same procedure established in this Article will be followed, but under this postulate [supuesto], the declaration to proceed will be for the effect of communicating it to the Local Legislatures, so that in the exercise of their attributions they may proceed correspondingly.
The declaration and resolutions of the Chambers of Deputies and Senators are unchallengeable.
The effect of the declaration that is grounds to proceed against the accused will be to suspend them [separarlo] from their responsibility [encargo] while they are subject to the criminal procedure. If this culminates in an absolutory decision [sentencia], the accused may resume their function. If the findings should be condemnatory and it concerns a crime committed during the exercise of their responsibility [encargo], the granting of pardon may not be conceded to the condemned [reo].
Claims [demandas] of civil order, that are initiated [entablen] against any public servant, will not require the declaration to proceed.
The criminal sanctions will be applied in accordance with that provided for in the criminal legislation, and concerning crimes by commission of which the authority obtained an economic benefit or caused damages or patrimonial prejudices, [these] must be graduated in accordance with the wealth [lucro] obtained and with the necessity to satisfy the damages and prejudices caused by their illicit conduct.
The economic sanctions may not exceed three times the benefit obtained or of the damages or prejudices caused.
Article 112
The declaration to proceed will not be required of the Chamber of Deputies when any of the public servants to whom the first paragraph of Article 111 makes reference commits a crime during the time in which they are suspended [se encuentre separado] from their responsibility [encargo].
If the public servant has returned [vuelto] to perform their own functions or has been appointed or elected to perform a different office [cargo], but one of those enumerated by Article 111, it will proceed in accordance with that provided for in that precept.
Article 113
The laws concerning administrative responsibilities of the public servants, shall determine their obligations with the objective of safeguarding the legality, honesty, loyalty, impartiality and efficiency in the performance of their functions, jobs, offices or commissions, the sanctions applicable for acts or omissions in which they incur, as well as the procedures and the authorities to apply them. These sanctions, in addition to those that the laws specify, will consist of suspension, dismissal and disqualification, as well as in economic sanctions, and they must be established in accordance with the economic benefits obtained by the responsible [person] and with the patrimonial damages and prejudices caused by their acts or omissions to which fraction III of Article 109 refers, but they may not exceed three times the benefits obtained or of the damages and prejudices caused.
The responsibility of the State for the damages that, by reason [motivo] of its irregular administrative activity, [are] caused to the assets or rights of individuals [particulares], will be objective and direct. The individual will have right to an indemnity in accordance with the bases, limits and procedures that the laws establish.
Article 114
The procedure of political trial may only be initiated during the time [período] in which the public servant performs their office [cargo] and in one year following. The corresponding sanctions will be applied in a time no greater than one year from the initiation of the procedure.
The responsibility for crimes committed during the time of responsibility [encargo] of any public servant, will be enforceable [exigible] in accordance with the times [plazos] of prescription specified in the Criminal Law, which will never be inferior to three years. The times of prescription are interrupted as long as the public servant performs any of the responsibilities [encargos] to which Article 111 makes reference.
The law will specify the cases of prescription of the administrative responsibility taking into account the nature and consequence of the acts or omissions to which fraction III of Article 109 makes reference. When these acts or omissions should be grave the times [plazos] of prescription will not be inferior to three years.
TITLE FIVE

Article 130
The historical principle of the separation of the State and the churches orients the norms contained in this Article. The churches and other religious groups will be subject to the law.

The formation of any type of political groupings is strictly prohibited, whose title contains any word or indication whatever that relates to any religious confession. Meetings of political character may not be held in churches [templos].
The simple oath [promesa] to tell the truth and to fulfill the obligations that one contracts, subjects the [person] making them, in case of failure [falta] to do so, to the penalties [that] the law establishes for that reason.
The ministers of beliefs, their ascendants, descendants, siblings and spouses, as well as the religious associations to which they belong, shall be incapable to inherit by testament, from those persons to whom their own ministries have directed themselves or helped spiritually and [who] have kinship [parentesco] within the fourth degree.

Article 133
This Constitution, the laws of the Congress of the Union that emanate from it, and all the Treaties that are in accord with them, celebrated and that are celebrated by the President of the Republic, with the approval of the Senate, will be the Supreme Law of all of the Union.

When the bidding mentioned in the preceding paragraph is not suitable [idóneas] to assure these conditions, the laws shall establish the bases, procedures, rules, requirements and other elements to accredit economy, efficacy, efficiency, impartiality and honesty that assure the best conditions for the State.

The public servants will be responsible for compliance with these bases in the terms of Title Four of this Constitution.
